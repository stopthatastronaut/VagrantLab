Where I do stuff with Vagrant

## What's useful?

The Calendar box deploys a 2019 Server which I remote into from a Surface RT stuck to my whiteboard - it shows my my calendar and email and a few other things while I'm whiteboarding. It deploys with CircleCI and Octopus Deploy

The Octopus stuff is potentially fun, if you work with Octopus.

Not much else really.
